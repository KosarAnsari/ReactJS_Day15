# React JS ‚Äì Day 15

## üìÖ 13/08/2025
Day 15 of my React JS learning journey.

## üìö Topics Covered
Today, I explored *two powerful ways* to style components in React:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CSS Modules
- CSS Modules help in writing *scoped CSS* so that styles apply only to the component where they are imported.
- Prevents *class name collisions* by generating unique class names automatically.
- Perfect for component-based styling.

*Example:*
```jsx
import styles from './UserProfile.module.css';

function UserProfile() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.card}>
      <h3 className={styles.name}>Anil Sidhu</h3>
      <p className={styles.role}>Software Developer</p>
    </div>
  );
}

2Ô∏è‚É£ Styled Components

A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components.

Allows writing actual CSS code inside JavaScript files.

Styles are tied directly to components.

Supports dynamic styling with props.


Example:

import styled from 'styled-components';

const Heading = styled.h1`
  color: pink;
  background-color: gray;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

const Heading2 = styled.h2`
  color: red;
  background-color: black;
  border: 5px solid green;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
`;

üí° Key Takeaways

CSS Modules are great for component-specific styles without worrying about naming conflicts.

Styled Components are more dynamic and allow you to write styles directly in JS files.

Both methods have their advantages, and the choice depends on the project requirements.
